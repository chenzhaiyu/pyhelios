# Helios++

Helios++ configuration for point cloud simulation on buildings.

## Prerequisite

Download one of the [Helios++ binaries](https://github.com/3dgeo-heidelberg/helios/releases) and extract it to the `./bin` directory. Probably change `import pyhelios` to `from bin import pyhelios` in `./bin/pyhelios/simulation_build.py`
